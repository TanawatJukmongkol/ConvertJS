What's my purpose?
 I can convert raw NBT file from https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/ into human
 readable instructions that is easy to read and follow. I can also convert the NBT
 mapart into a clean JSON file format for other uses too! 

How do I use it?:
 Configure some of the options inside the convert.js.
 You may also need to install Node.js

The output JSON file structure looks like this:

{
    blocks:[
        ---- z position ---->
        [{pos:[x <int>,y <int>,z <int>],state:<int>},{},{}, ... ,{}] |
        [{},{},{}, ... ,{}]                                          | X position
        [{},{},{}, ... ,{}]                                          |
        [{},{},{}, ... ,{}]                                          V
    ],
    palette:["minecraft:birch_plank","","", ... , ""],
    size:[x <int>,y <int>,z <int>]
}

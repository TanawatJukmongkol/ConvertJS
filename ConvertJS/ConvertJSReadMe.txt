What's my purpose?
 I can convert raw NBT file from https://rebane2001.com/mapartcraft/ into human
 readable instructions that is easy to read and follow. I can also convert the NBT
 mapart into a clean JSON file format for other uses too! 

How do I use it?:
 Configure some of the options inside the convert.js.
 You may also need to install Node.js
